\title{Deep Q-Learning For Molecule Optimization}


% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
We present a framework, which we call Molecule Deep Q-Networks (MolDQN), 
for molecule optimization by combining domain knowledge of chemistry and
state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques.
We apply parallel algorithm MolDQN which achieves comparable
or better performance against several other recently published algorithms
for benchmark molecular optimization tasks. 
However, we also argue that many of these tasks are not representative of real optimization problems 
in drug discovery. Inspired by problems faced during medicinal chemistry lead optimization,
we extend our model with multi-objective reinforcement learning,
which maximizes drug-likeness while maintaining similarity to the original molecule.
We further show the path through chemical space to achieve optimization for a molecule to understand how the model works.
We improve the basic method and save 9\% run time.
Our Code can be seen on \url{https://github.com/StivenKingsberg/Molecure-OPT}.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning}

% 介绍背景
One fundamental goal in chemistry is to design new molecules with specific desired properties.
This is especially important in material design or drug screening.
Currently, this process is expensive in terms of time and cost:
It can take years and cost millions of dollars to find a new drug1 .
The goal of this study is to partially automate this process through reinforcement learning.
%说一下transformer和RL的方法的优劣
To appreciate our approach, it is necessary to review briefly the previous works that employed machine learning in molecule design. 
One prevalent strategy is to build a generative model, which maps a point in a high-dimensional latent space to a molecule, 
and perform search or optimization in the latent space to find new molecules. 
Gómez-Bombarelli et al. 2 , Blaschke et al. 3 , Segler et al. 4 , Lim et al. 5 , 
and Putin et al. 6 utilized strings as molecule representations to build a generator of SMILES7 strings, 
which is a linear string notation to describe molecular structures. 
One of the most challenging goals in this design is to ensure the chemical validity of the generated molecules. 
Kusner et al. 8 and Dai et al. 9 added grammar constraints to SMILES strings to improve the chemical validity of the generated molecules. 
Researchers have also built models on graph representations of molecules, which regards atoms as nodes and bonds as edges in an undirected graph. 
Li et al. 10 and Li et al. 11 described molecule generators that create graphs in a step-wise manner. 
De Cao & Kipf 12 introduced MolGAN for generating small molecular graphs. Jin et al. 13 designed a two-step generation process in which a tree is first constructed to represent the molecular scaffold and then expanded to a molecule. 
Although almost perfect on generating valid molecules, these autoencoder-based models usually need to address the problem of optimization. 
Most published work uses a separate Gaussian process model on the latent space for optimization. 
However, because the latent space is often high dimensional and the objective functions defined on the latent space is usually non-convex, 
molecule property optimization on the latent space can be difficult.
%为什么选RL
Another strategy is based on reinforcement learning, 
which is a sub-field of artificial intelligence. 
Reinforcement learning studies the way to make decisions to achieve the highest reward. 
Olivecrona et al. 14 , Guimaraes et al.15 , Putin et al. 16 , and Popova et al. 17 applied reinforcement learning techniques on top of a string generator to generate the SMILES strings of molecules. 
They successfully generated molecules with given desirable properties, but struggled with chemical validity. 
Recently, You et al. 18 proposed a graph convolutional policy network (GCPN) for generating graph representations of molecules with deep reinforcement learning, 
achieving 100\% validity. 
However, all these methods require pre-training on a specific dataset. 
While pre-training makes it easier to generate molecules similar to the given training set, 
the exploration ability is limited by the biases present in the training data.
\subsection{MolDQN's advantage and shortcoming}
%为什么用MolDQN 
Here we introduce a new design for molecule optimization by combining chemistry domain knowledge and reinforcement learning, 
which we call Molecule Deep Q-Networks (MolDQN). 
We formulate the modification of a molecule as a Markov decision process (MDP) 19 . 
By only allowing chemically valid actions, 
we ensure that all the molecules generated are valid. 
We then employ the deep reinforcement learning technique of DeepQ-Networks (DQN) 20 to solve this MDP, 
using the desired properties as rewards. Instead of pre-training on a dataset, 
our model learns from scratch. Additionally, 
with the introduction of multi-objective deep reinforcement learning, 
our model is capable of performing multi-objective optimization.
%介绍一个代码的使用
However, MolDQN serves as a linear timeline function, which lack parrellel and ansychonous.
We introduce parrellel and ansychonous method in this function, thus we can cut down runtime.

\section{Methods}
\label{gen_inst}


The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).  Use 10~point
type with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11~points.  Times New Roman is the
preferred typeface throughout, and will be selected for you by default.
Paragraphs are separated by \nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no
indentation.


The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold, centered
between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points thick and the
bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow \nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and
below the title to rules. All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the
top of the page.


For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is
centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's name is to be listed
first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if different address) are set to
follow. If there is only one co-author, list both author and co-author side by
side.


Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.

%实验和数据分析
\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}


All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
flush left, and bold.


First-level headings should be in 12-point type.


\subsection{Headings: second level}


Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.


\subsubsection{Headings: third level}


Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.


\paragraph{Paragraphs}


There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the heading in
bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the heading followed by 1\,em
of space.

%结论
\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}


These instructions apply to everyone.


\subsection{Citations within the text}


The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
used consistently.


The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}


If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
following before loading the \verb+neurips_2022+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}


If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2022}
\end{verbatim}


As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
(e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''


\subsection{Footnotes}


Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).


Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}


\subsection{Figures}


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}


All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.


You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
color.


\subsection{Tables}


All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.


Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.


Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.


\begin{table}
  \caption{Sample table title}
  \label{sample-table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
    \cmidrule(r){1-2}
    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
    \midrule
    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section{Final instructions}


Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
\textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
numbered.


\section{Preparing PDF files}


Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
example, ``A4.''


Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
achieve this.


\begin{itemize}


\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.


\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
  menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
  also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
  available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.


\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose fonts are also
  acceptable for NeurIPS. Please see
  \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}


\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
  "solid" shapes instead.


\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
  the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.


\end{itemize}


If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
you to fix it.


\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}


Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})


A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
necessary.


\begin{ack}
Use unnumbered first level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments
go at the end of the paper before the list of references. Moreover, you are required to declare
funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work).
More information about this disclosure can be found at: \url{https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/PaperInformation/FundingDisclosure}.


Do {\bf not} include this section in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper. You can use the \texttt{ack} environment provided in the style file to autmoatically hide this section in the anonymized submission.
\end{ack}


\section*{References}


References follow the acknowledgments. Use unnumbered first-level heading for
the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable as long as you are
consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font size to \verb+small+ (9 point)
when listing the references.
Note that the Reference section does not count towards the page limit.
